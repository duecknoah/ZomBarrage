<h2>A Top down 2D arcade shooter wave survivor game twisted up in a zombie apocalypse</h2>
<h3>This seems to look very similiar to the Cut Off Game you made, whats going on?</h3>
<p>
This a clone of the Cut Off Game Project when the Cut Off Game Project was in early development. However, in this version, I decided to branch off from where I was in the Cut Off Game Project and change it into a wave survivor game. Rather than being a story-driven game, I want to start off simple and possibly take the assets from this one and implement it into the Cut Off Game in the future.
