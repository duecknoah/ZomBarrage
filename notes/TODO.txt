Improvements to make:
----------------------------------------------------
- POWERUPS (random weapon ?, ammo restock, speed boost, zombie stun (makes zombies confused and not move for 5 seconds), 2x points)
- Improve backup pathfinding
- Fix bug that makes player unable to punch or swing sword
 Give player invunerability for a few seconds after exiting a loot area
- Add start wave option to instantly start wave
- Make it so hotkeys (ex. h) would make player select any healing items in their inventory and / or secondary
- Make more ammo spawn (airdrops n stufF)
- Fix fire gui not stretching based off of window size

- REFIX COLLISIONS!! As i moved from origin to top left for collisions!
- Show Press 'TAB' tab under upgrade bar
- make upgrade bar flash once when you can afford a new thing
- Make health bar flash slowly when healing
- Make health bar blink when low
- Make weapon slot turn red when there is no more ammo left in a weapon that has ammo
- Allow getting collatoral damage and lots of kills in one time give you extra points
- Show wave and then total stats at end of wave completion
- Remove the text of the communicator, just have an objective system with arrows and simple text instead as its a simple arcade game
- When a level is completed, transition into main menu level selection and have effect of the next level being unlocked
- Have a music playlist play throughout the game when fighting. Every song change have the song name and artist show at the bottom somewhere and fade out.

- Add a time limit in looting
- Make it show weapon damage on gun when holding it
- Make it so each gun has a maxstack amount. You could use this variable with lootRank to lerp the ammo between 0 and the max amount
- prevent punching while in car
- allow storing a couple weapons in your truck to carry between levels, this would mean saving the trucks inventory in saveDynamic
----------------------------------------------------
Bugs to fix:
----------------------------------------------------
- heavy zombie moving towards player while throwing rock or punch while in backup pathfinding
- Possible memory leaks due to static particle systems not destroying particle emitters at end of room / game (first check if obj_particleIndex dose this already)
- Player inventory not saving properly, currently I'm avoiding this by loading a clear inventory each time. It is partly setup, but it gets overridden by the map saves inventory as well.

To make maps more challenging, make them more tight spaced. EDIT: not too tight spaced, else zombies have a hard time finding a path, this can cause lag quickly 

upgrade idea: faster shooting speed (temporary)
