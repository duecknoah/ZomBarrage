Improvements to make:
- Make it so hotkeys (ex. h) would make player select any healing items in their inventory and / or secondary
- Make it so player can use numbers 1-6 for inventory
- Make more ammo spawn (airdrops n stufF)
- Find a way to make weapons spawn in a cool way
- Fix bug that makes player unable to punch or swing sword

- Add a time limit in looting
- Make 'sunrise' at end of wave, and 'sunset' at start of wave 
- Make it so where you click is where the grenade / molotov goes
- Make it show weapon damage on gun when holding it
- Make it so each gun has a maxstack amount. You could use this variable with lootRank to lerp the ammo between 0 and the max amount
- prevent punching while in car
- allow storing a couple weapons in your truck to carry between levels, this would mean saving the trucks inventory in saveDynamic

Bugs to fix:
- undefined value sometimes when looting, crashing game
- heavy zombie moving towards player while throwing rock or punch while in backup pathfinding
- Buildings not staying faded, usually after looting
- Possible memory leaks due to static particle systems not destroying particle emitters at end of room / game (first check if obj_particleIndex dose this already)
- Player inventory not saving properly, currently I'm avoiding this by loading a clear inventory each time. It is partly setup, but it gets overridden by the map saves inventory as well.

To make maps more challenging, make them more tight spaced.

upgrade idea: faster shooting speed (temporary)

- maybe rather than creating obj_pointText entitys on the ground, maybe make them appear in the gui right below the upgrades tab. Also maybe show points on the outside of the upgrade tab as well




Quick notes:
Make it so the backup pathfinding of the runnerZombie doesn't make it go super slow compared to its normal speed
Ammo can be a problem, maybe power ups that drop that solve that??
