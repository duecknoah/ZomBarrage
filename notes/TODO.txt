Improvements to make:
- make it so you dont loot so much, adjust loot rank
- show total points in upgrade menu
- improve pause screen, make it pause instantly
- Find a way to make weapons spawn in a cool way
- allow loot keys and flashlights to have their own special inventory slots
- make health of zombies increase more higher as waves go on
- make collatoral damage not be infinite
- increase time between waves

Bugs to fix:
- make it so weapon ammo can stack when looting
- heavy zombie moving towards player while throwing rock or punch while in backup pathfinding
- SWORD DOESN'T WORK!!!3
- FireLights not dissappearing on zombie kill sometimes
- Buildings not staying faded, usually after looting
- prevent allowing picking up two of the same weapon, this happens when you have a gun in the second slot while the first slot is empty. Then when you pickup the same weapon as in slot 2, it will go in slot 1 and not stack when it should.

To make maps more challenging, make them more tight spaced.

upgrade idea: faster shooting speed (temporary)

- maybe rather than creating obj_pointText entitys on the ground, maybe make them appear in the gui right below the upgrades tab. Also maybe show points on the outside of the upgrade tab as well
