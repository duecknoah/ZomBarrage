Improvements to make:
- make it so you dont loot so much, adjust loot rank
- show total points in upgrade menu
- improve pause screen, make it pause instantly
- Find a way to make weapons spawn in a cool way
- allow loot keys and flashlights to have their own special inventory slots
- make health of zombies increase more higher as waves go on
- make collatoral damage not be infinite
- increase time between waves
- Make 'sunrise' at end of wave, and 'sunset' at start of wave 
- Make it so where you click is where the grenade / molotov goes
- Make it show weapon damage on gun when holding it
- Make it so each zombie begins spawning at a specific wave, rather than all starting at wave 1
- Make it so each gun has a maxstack amount. You could use this variable with lootRank to lerp the ammo between 0 and the max amount

Bugs to fix:
- make it so weapon ammo can stack when looting
- heavy zombie moving towards player while throwing rock or punch while in backup pathfinding
- FireLights not dissappearing on zombie kill sometimes
- Buildings not staying faded, usually after looting
- prevent allowing picking up two of the same weapon, this happens when you have a gun in the second slot while the first slot is empty. Then when you pickup the same weapon as in slot 2, it will go in slot 1 and not stack when it should.
- Possible memory leaks due to static particle systems not destroying particle emitters at end of room / game (first check if obj_particleIndex dose this already)

To make maps more challenging, make them more tight spaced.

upgrade idea: faster shooting speed (temporary)

- maybe rather than creating obj_pointText entitys on the ground, maybe make them appear in the gui right below the upgrades tab. Also maybe show points on the outside of the upgrade tab as well




Quick notes:
Make it so the backup pathfinding of the runnerZombie doesn't make it go super slow compared to its normal speed
Ammo can be a problem, maybe power ups that drop that solve that??
